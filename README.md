# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm Cynthia. I'm passionate about learning and I'm currently working on strengthening my programming skills. <br><br>I'm currently working on new projects so I can learn new technologies. I want to create a portfolio website soon to be able to efficiently showcase my projects. I recently created a website for a small dessert business, using Agile methodology. For my senior capstone, I worked on a 2D Platformer game with a few classmates. It was created in Godot using GodotScript. The game was developed using the top-down development method. You can check out those projects here. <br><br>I like drawing and painting. I recently started playing pc games which sparked my interest in eventually developing a game of my own! I am also interested in full stack development, AI, and human-computer interactions.
